### Location of Deployment.

https://buttertutorial-n0trf5lj4-bitterhippo.vercel.app/

### Assumptions made.

Drop Down Menus : I didn't add the icons or flesh or create the drop down menus.
FootNavLinks : There was an over textDecoration: underline that could have been added to the embedded divs in this section. I didn't bother with this because the links don't currently go anywhere.

### Shortcuts/Compromises made.

1) I couldn't fully animate the main imageBanner component. I don't have a familiarity with animations and although I did install dependencies for it (CSSTransitionGroup and React Spring), I didn't have enough time to go through tutorials and make this work.
2) I initialized the project with create-react-app as opposed to building it from scratch with webpack.

### Instructions to run assignment locally.

-npm start is the default script that will get everything going.

### What did you not include in your solution that you want us to know about?

### Other information about your submission that you feel it's important we know if applicable.

None.
